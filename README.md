# Classifying and Predicting Energy Consumption in Regions of the Eastern U.S.

Using unsupervised and supervised machine learning based on the features of twelve time series on data from PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data on Kaggle, which included hourly energy consumption in megawatts (MW) for regions served by PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM). PJM provides electricity transmission in the Eastern United States, and each time series represented a different region served by PJM. Data cleaning, EDA of all time series data, unsupervised learning method (K-means clustering), and supervised learning model (Prophet model) was used to forecast 12 months ahead for this project. 

Data from the Kaggle source was collected from the PJM website.
